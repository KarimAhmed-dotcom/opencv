#people detection and count
#this project for detecting people and count them 

- firstly , to keep tracking anything it has to be moving ,so i'm depend on the difference between two frames to detect moving people
 
- then i craeted a threshold trackbar to detect the optimal thershold values for moving people

- then i craedted a simple rectangle on them

- i tried also to use canny edge detection to compare which one is better

- so i used canny edge detection technique for detecting the edges of traking things

- then created a trackbar for get minimum and maximum values for canny 

- then i craedted a simple rectangle on them 

- finaly i prented number of rectangles on the top of the screen as the numer of people

- this is my simple project , i hope you like it
